                After almost a decade of working dead-end jobs, I decided it was time to take control over my trajectory in life. It was time to learn a skill I could use to make myself more valuable as an employee, so I decided to learn how to write code.

                I enrolled in the UW Coding Bootcamp from June 14th, 2021 to September 7, 2021. Upon completion of the course I received my Full-Stack Flex Web Developer certificate.
